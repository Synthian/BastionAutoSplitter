# Bastion Auto Splitter
By valentinoIAN and Vulajin

#### What it Does

The autosplitter is currently capable of starting and ending your splits, resetting your splits whenever you start a new game, as well as splitting whenever a load screen begins. This splitter is currently unable to split upon using objects, so the split times will not match the classic Skyway split method.

#### Options (In Layout Component Settings)

**Split Upon returning to the Bastion** - Toggles splitting everytime you return to the Bastion, UNLESS you just came from the Ura Invasion.  
**Split Rock in the Sky** - Toggles splitting upon loading the Wharf District Map  
**Split when entering Prosper** - Toggles splitting when you enter Prosper Bluff. This is only not wanted in Any Weapons, presumably.  
**Split after Burstone Quarry** - Toggles splitting when loading the Ura Invasion.
**Split Tazal I** - Toggles splitting when you load the map with the Battering Ram pickup on it.  
**Begin Splits** - Toggles starting your splits when the kid gets up.
**End Splits** - Toggles ending your splits upon input being disabled at the end of the game.
**Auto Reset** - Toggles resetting your splits when you load into the Rippling Walls map.
